The script will read a CSV file, create each user on the server, and add the created user(s) to an existing group called developers. It will also check for the existence of the user on the system before it will attempt to create it. Each user will have a default home folder with a .ssh folder within its home folder. For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, the script will create an authorized_keys file and add a given public key to it.
